# Day 1: Project Setup Script

## Objective
The goal was to write a Bash script that:
1. Creates a new directory called `my-bashproject`.
2. Cross-check to see if a directory has been created with the specified name to avoid the script returning errors
3. Changes into the new directory.
4. Creates three empty files: `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`.
5. Lists the contents of the directory.
6. Prints a message saying "Project setup complete!"

## Script
The script (`my-projects.sh`) uses basic Bash commands like `mkdir`, `cd`, `touch`, and `ls`.

## Output should look like this:
file1.txt  file2.txt  file3.txt
Project setup complete!

## What I Learned
How to use if statements to check if a directory exists.
Creating and navigating directories using Bash.
Writing output to the terminal.
